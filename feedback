Hi Ernesto,
Sorry for late reply.
Candidates evaluating process for this position includes 3 steps:
1.	Offline case study submit and reviewed by my team under me
2.	1st round interview(If case study submitted is validated promising) with my team under me
3.	2nd round interview(If 1st round interview passed) with me.

My team confirmed you did not show expected results during step 1(on case study) e.g. 
•	ex. 1 - duplicates in the result, didn't use product_id in join, no sum
•	ex. 2 - no final count
•	ex. 3 - no partition by user_id

Based on group discussion result, team decided not to continue doing interviews with you for next steps.
Hopes helpful and clear.

Thanks.
